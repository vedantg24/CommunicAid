Humans communicate with one another in order to share their views, emotions, and stories with other people. For people suffering from communication disorder, it is not the case. Deaf-mute people can interact owing to sign language. The idea of this research is to build a system for identifying sign language that allows people with speech impairments and regular people to communicate, bridging the communication barrier. Furthermore, being able to recognize common sentences that are used frequently becomes crucial for conversations to flow effectively. Such a system is essential in services like banking where privacy would be a top priority.
